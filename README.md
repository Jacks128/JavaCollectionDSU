# <h1 align="center">Java Collection :computer:</h1> 

<p align="justify">If we talk about Collections we understand a group of objects, and if we talk about Java Collections, we understand a Java group of objects. In technical terms it is a framework (Set of classes and interfaces which provide a ready-made architecture) that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion. Java Collection means a single unit of objects, it provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet). </p>

Exists differents types of collections:
## Set:
<p align="justify">The Set interface defines a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. This interface contains only the methods inherited from Collection adding the restriction that duplicate elements are prohibited
The most frequently used implementation are:</p>
- HashSet <br>
- TreeSet <br>
- LinkedHashSet <br>

## List:
<p align="justify">The List interface defines a sequence of elements. Unlike the Set interface, the List interface does support duplicate elements.
The most frequently used implementation are:</p>
- ArrayList <br>
- LinkedList <br>
- Vector <br>

## Queue:
<p align="justify">As the name suggests, a queue interface maintains the FIFO(First In First Out) order similar to a real-world queue line. This interface is dedicated to storing all the elements where the order of the elements matter.
The most frequently used implementation are:</p>
- Priority Queue <br>

## Map:
<p align="justify">A map is a data structure which supports the key-value pair mapping for the data. This interface doesnâ€™t support duplicate keys because the same key cannot have multiple mappings. A map is useful if there is a data and we wish to perform operations on the basis of the key.
The most frequently used implementation are:</p>
- Hashtable <br>
- Hashmap <br>
- LinkedHashMap <br>
- TreeMap <br>
